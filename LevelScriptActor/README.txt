The level script actor was created to create slightly cinematic moments in the game, Light Repair Team 4.

When a level starts the script begins a fade in, allows the player pawn to pick up items, and then waits for completion.

Once a level is completed, the player pawn is locked from picking up items, and lights around the city turn on. Once the lights have all turned on, the game fades out, and then loads the next level.

The effect can be seen either in game, or in the game's trailer. https://store.steampowered.com/app/444530/Light_Repair_Team_4/
